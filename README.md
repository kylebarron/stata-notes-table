# stata-notes-table
## Stata code to make summary tables in an automated fashion.

This code will export summary tables into pipe-delimited .txt files. This is close to a pipe-delimited table format that [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables) can read (and then transform to TeX, Word, HTML, or PDF format), or you can also use another [package](https://github.com/mcaceresb/tablefill) to transform these into TeX/LyX format.

This code was originally written by [Mauricio Caceres](https://github.com/mcaceresb).
